# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
 Good Data Visualization Example: Global Temperature Trends (Line Chart)
ðŸ“Š Source: NASA Climate Change (https://climate.nasa.gov/)

Why This is a Good Visualization
This line chart effectively communicates global temperature trends over time using best practices in data visualization.

Clarity and Simplicity (Tufte, 1983)

Edward Tufteâ€™s principles emphasize minimizing non-essential elements to avoid clutter.
This visualization presents a clear X-axis (years) and Y-axis (temperature changes), ensuring the viewer quickly understands the trend.
Proper Chart Selection (Few, 2004)

Line charts are ideal for showing trends over time, as they allow for easy comparison of changes across years.
Using a line instead of bars prevents unnecessary complexity.
Effective Use of Color and Labels (Cairo, 2016)

Red and blue colors effectively communicate warming and cooling trends, aligning with intuitive interpretations.
Labels and a baseline reference make the data easy to understand without additional explanation.
Data Integrity & Context (Cleveland & McGill, 1984)

The chart does not exaggerate trends or distort data.
It includes historical context, allowing for an accurate interpretation of climate change over time.
 Overall: The visualization is clear, accurate, and easy to interpret, making it a strong example of effective data communication.

Bad Data Visualization Example: Smartphone Market Share (3D Pie Chart)
ðŸ“Š Source: Example from a blog misusing pie charts

Why This is a Bad Visualization
This 3D pie chart fails to effectively communicate information due to multiple design flaws.

Distortion & Misleading Representation (Tufte, 1983; Few, 2004)

3D effects distort proportions, making some slices appear larger or smaller than they actually are.
The depth perspective skews the viewerâ€™s perception of actual market share.
Ineffective Chart Type (Cleveland & McGill, 1984)

Pie charts are notoriously poor at allowing accurate comparisons between categories, especially with multiple slices.
A bar chart would have been a better alternative, as it allows for precise comparisons of market share values.
Lack of Readability & Accessibility (Cairo, 2016)

The chart does not include clear percentage labels, making it difficult to extract insights.
Too many slices cause visual clutter, which overwhelms the viewer instead of guiding them.
Color Misuse (Few, 2004)

If colors are too similar, they blend together and make interpretation harder.
If colors are random, they lack semantic meaning, confusing the audience.
 Overall: The 3D pie chart misleads the viewer and makes comparisons difficult, violating best practices in data visualization. A bar chart would have been a more effective alternative.

Final Comparison & Key Takeaways
Aspect	Good Visualization (Line Chart)	Bad Visualization (3D Pie Chart)
Chart Type	Line chart (appropriate for trends)	3D Pie chart (distorted, ineffective)
Readability	Clear labels, well-structured	Hard to interpret due to 3D effect
Color Use	Intuitive color choices (red/blue)	No clear meaning behind colors
Data Integrity	Accurately represents data	Misleading proportions
Clutter	Minimal, focused on key trend	Too many slices, overwhelming
 Conclusion: This analysis demonstrates the importance of choosing the right chart, minimizing distortion, and ensuring readability in data visualization.


    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      The 3D pie chart presenting smartphone market share has multiple issues that hinder its effectiveness. To improve it, we should focus on choosing a better chart type, enhancing readability, and removing unnecessary distortions.

1. Use a Bar Chart Instead of a 3D Pie Chart
One of the biggest issues is that pie charts are not ideal for comparing multiple categories, especially in 3D. A bar chart would be a better choice because:

It allows for precise comparisons between smartphone brands.
Viewers can quickly assess differences in market share since bar heights are easier to compare than pie slices.
It avoids distortions caused by the 3D effect.
2. Improve Labeling & Data Presentation
The current chart lacks percentage labels, making it hard to understand exact market shares.
Adding data labels on each bar in a bar chart ensures clarity.
The X-axis should list smartphone brands, and the Y-axis should represent market share (0%â€“100%), making it easy to interpret.
3. Use Meaningful Colors
In the pie chart, colors appear random, making it difficult to associate them with brands.
A better approach is to use consistent, brand-recognizable colors (e.g., Apple in gray, Samsung in blue, etc.).
Avoid using too many colorsâ€”grouping smaller brands into an "Others" category simplifies interpretation.
4. Keep It 2D for Accuracy
The 3D effect distorts proportions, misleading the audience.
A flat, 2D visualization ensures accuracy and maintains proportionality between different brands' market shares.
Conclusion
By switching to a bar chart, improving labels and colors, and removing 3D distortion, the visualization would be much clearer and more effective. The goal of data visualization is to communicate information efficiently, and these changes would ensure the viewer quickly grasps the market share distribution.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
